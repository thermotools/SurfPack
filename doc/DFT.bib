A recently developed version for the monocomponent case is extended to mixtures of hard spheres with different radii, and a new prescription is presented for obtaining the exact dimensional crossover of those mixtures in the one-dimensional (1D) limit.

  abstract = {This study analyzes the adsorption behavior in twodimensional heterogeneous slit pores using nonlocal density functional theory based on the perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) equation of state. Both chemical heterogeneity and surface roughness on small atomistic scales are investigated. The solid structure is considered as individual solid interaction sites whereby chemical heterogeneity is introduced through the presence of different solid-fluid sites and molecular roughness by varying the position of the interaction sites in the first solid layers. The effect of both forms of heterogeneity on the adsorption behavior is assessed individually. Effective onedimensional solid-fluid potentials provide a way to reduce the dimensionality and computational demand of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We determine one-dimensional free-energy-averaged (FEA) solid-fluid potentials of methane and n-butane in the low-density limit for solid systems with molecular roughness and chemical heterogeneity. Using this effective onedimensional solid-fluid potential at any density, we find excellent agreement of adsorption isotherms for both solid descriptions in systems with homogeneous slit pores. Subcritical adsorption isotherms of n-butane in slit pores with surface roughness show deviations at higher pressures due to the formation of fluid layers in the one-dimensional FEA potential. Chemical heterogeneity introduces a shift of the capillary condensation pressure below the saturation pressure of the bulk liquid, which is well described by the free-energy-averaged system.},

Our approach is based on a Helmholtz free-energy functional that is consistent with the Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) equation of state. This allows for a coarse-grained description of the solvent based on an inhomogeneous density of PC-SAFT segments. The solute, on the other hand, is described in full detail by atomistic Lennard-Jones interaction sites. The approach is entirely predictive as it only takes the PC-SAFT parameters of the solvent and the force-field parameters of the solute as input. No adjustable parameters or empirical corrections are involved. The framework is applied to study self-solvation of n-alkanes and to the calculation of residual chemical potentials in binary solvent mixtures. Our DFT approach accurately predicts solvation free energies of small molecular solutes in three different non-polar solvents, namely n-hexane, cyclohexane, and benzene. Additionally, we show that the calculated solvation free energies agree well with those obtained by molecular dynamics simulations and with the residual chemical potential calculated by the bulk PC-SAFT equation of state. We observe higher deviations for the solvation free energy of systems with significant solute\textendash solvent Coulomb interactions.},

It is argued that conventional capillary wave theory, which leads to divergences in the width of the density profile, is unsatisfactory for describing all the equilibrium aspects of the interface. The density functional formalism which has been developed to study the liquid vapour interface can also be profitably applied to other problems in the statistical mechanics of non-uniform fluids; here a new generalization of the 'linear' theory of spinodal decomposition is formulated and by considering a 'nearly uniform' fluid, some useful results for the long-wavelength behaviour of the liquid structure factor of various monatomic liquids are obtained.

We have developed both three-dimensional real space and Fourier space algorithms. The former rely on a matrix-based Newton's method while the latter couple fast Fourier transforms with a matrix-free Newton's method. Efficient computation of phase diagrams and investigation of multiple solutions is facilitated with phase transition tracking algorithms and arclength continuation algorithms. We have explored the performance that can be obtained by application of massively parallel computing, and have begun application of the codes to a variety of two- and three-dimensional systems. In this paper, we summarize our algorithm development work as well as briefly discuss a few applications including adsorption and transport in ion channel proteins, capillary condensation in disordered porous media and confinement effects in a diblock copolymer fluid.},

  abstract = {We present a density functional theory (DFT) based on the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) bulk free energy to describe the behaviour of inhomogeneous associating molecular fluids, with a special emphasis on the vapour\textendash liquid interface. The molecules are described in terms of hard-sphere (HS) segments which interact through an arbitrary intermolecular potential. Off-centre square-well bonding sites are incorporated to mediate the association between molecules. The approach presented here is based on a perturbation theory about a HS reference fluid under the local density approximation (LDA); the contributions due to chain formation and association are also considered at the local density level. The Helmholtz free energy functional due to the dispersive attractive interactions is treated at the mean-field level by ignoring the correlations. This description is essentially a `van der Waals' theory of non-uniform fluids. The incorporation of a SAFT free energy of the bulk associating fluid represents the simplest extension of the theory to deal with inhomogeneous associating systems (SAFT\textendash DFT). The resulting functional is used to investigate the effect of the range of the attractive interactions on the interfacial properties, such as the density profile and surface tension, for two different intermolecular potential models, namely the Yukawa and square-well. This simple SAFT\textendash DFT approach is also used to make quantitative comparisons with the experimental surface tension for water. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Mixture adsorption is investigated for the methane/ethane and methane/n-butane binary systems. Excellent agreement between PC-SAFT DFT and GCMC is obtained for all adsorption isotherms up to pressures of 50 bar. The cDFT formalism accurately predicts the selective accumulation of longer hydrocarbons for binary mixtures in the considered COFs. This application shows substantial predictive power of PC-SAFT DFT solved in three-dimensional geometries and the results suggest the method can in the future also be applied for efficient optimization of force field parameters or of structural properties of the porous material based on an analytical theory as opposed to a stochastic simulation.},

The Helmholtz energy functional is suitable for inhomogeneous fluid phases and is here applied to vapor- liquid systems. The attractive branch of the van der Waals attractions are treated with a perturbation theory of first order in a nonmean field approach. The radial distribution function is considered in the Percus-Yevick closure for chain fluids with a threefluid theory approach. This perturbation term is brought to consistency with the PCP-SAFT equation of state using the approach of Gloor et al. [Gloor, G. J.; Jackson, G.; Blas, F. J.; del Rio, E. M.; de Miguel, E. J. Chem.

Binary mixtures with two subcritical components as well as mixtures with one species above its critical point, for the considered temperature, are considered. The density functional theory is applied to these systems with unaltered pure component parameters of the PC-SAFT or PCP-SAFT model. The binary interaction parameter was determined to bulk-phase vapor-liquid data (temperature, pressure, composition) only. Excellent agreement was found for the surface tension of mixtures without any model parameter adjusted to interfacial properties.},

  abstract = {The interfacial tensions of liquid-liquid mixtures are rarely measured, despite their importance, for example, in extraction processes. In this work, we applied classical density functional theory to liquid-liquid interfaces of binary mixtures and evaluated the predicted interfacial tensions. The functional was based on the statistical associating fluid theory with a polar perturbed-chain contribution to the dispersive term (PCP-SAFT). To ensure a good representation of the liquid-liquid equilibrium of the bulk phases, we applied two binary interaction parameters. Interfacial tensions were predicted without adjusting any model parameter to interfacial properties. For several methanol and ethylene glycol systems, we found good agreement with existing experimental data on interfacial tensions. Limitations in the accuracy of the Helmholtz energy functional were seen for aqueous liquid mixtures, for which phase equilibria were not modeled with sufficient agreement to experimental data, preventing a meaningful prediction of interfacial tensions.},

Predicted surface tensions of pure substances are in very good agreement with experimental data for systems of non-polar as well as polar compounds including biodiesel systems where the group-contribution approach proves especially advantageous. The average deviation of the proposed model from experimental data is only 5\% for these substances. Short hydrogen-bonding compounds, such as methanol and ethanol, are not predicted convincingly well. For longer hydrogen-bonding molecules the results are satisfying and deviations decrease to values of 3e10\% for the entire liquid-vapor region. The orientation of hydrogen-bonding molecules at the vapor-liquid interface is reproduced qualitatively by the proposed model. Surface tensions for mixtures (including mixtures with hydrogen-bonding components) are predicted surprisingly well, with average deviations from experimental data of 5\%. For mixtures, transferable group-group interaction parameters are adjusted to binary vapor-liquid equilibria data. The description of vapor-liquid phase equilibria is thereby significantly improved, however, the improvement of predicted surface tensions is mild. Further, in order to compensate for a weakness of group-contribution equations of state, we propose a concept for individualizing the group-contribution approach for substances that are well characterized by experimental data. We introduce a component-specific parameter. This concept improves the description mostly of vapor pressures, especially for short and multi-functional molecules. The effect of this measure on predicted surface tensions, however, is very modest.},

  abstract = {This study compares surface tensions as calculated from the classical density functional theory (DFT) and from density gradient theory (DGT) to experimental data. This comparison is inevitably not on equal ground, because the DFT is purely predictive for interfacial properties, both for pure substances and for mixtures, whereas DGT requires an adjustable influence parameter for each pure component (adjusted to surface tension data) and possibly a further adjustable parameter for each binary pair. In that sense, our comparison takes the perspective of a user who, because experimental data is available, finds it acceptable to correlate interfacial properties with adjustable parameters but who can alternatively decide for applying the DFT method. The perturbed-chain polar statistical associating fluid theory (PCPSAFT) is used to determine phase equilibrium properties as well as the local Helmholtz energy density for DGT. For DFT, a Helmholtz energy functional consistent with PCP-SAFT is applied. DGT correlations and DFT predictions of surface tension for pure components as well as results for mixtures agree very well and exhibit excellent agreement to reference data for non-associating non-polar and polar molecules. Only for pure associating compounds, the adjustable parameter of DGT leads to significant improvements over DFT results. For mixtures, depending on the system, results can be better for either method. In the case of alkane-alcohol mixtures, DGT with the geometric combining rule for the cross-wise influence parameter leads to non-physically steep gradients in the density profiles. Adjusting a binary correction parameter for the influence parameter to experimental mixture surface tension data helps to alleviate this problem. However, the practical utility of this binary correction parameter to improve mixture surface tension results is very limited. We conclude that DFT is for most applications a preferable approach.},

One possibility is to model the surfactant molecules as heteronuclear chains. Therefore, we revisit the heterosegmented density functional theory and present a theory consistent with the group contribution perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory equation of state. The model is used to study water/surfactant and water/surfactant/octane systems with surfactants from the group of polyethylene glycol alkyl ethers, a commonly used group of nonionic surfactants. The model parameters are obtained by fitting to pure component data of small surfactants. Binary interaction parameters are required to model the water/alkane subsystem and to account for the polarity of the head groups of the surfactant. The model is able to reproduce the significant enrichment of surfactant molecules at both vapor-liquid surfaces and liquid-liquid interfaces and the corresponding reduction of interfacial tensions. For liquid-liquid interfaces, the competing solubility of the surfactant in both phases has to be taken into account when searching for an optimal surfactant molecule.},

The DFT problem is written in cylindrical coordinates, and the solid-fluid interactions are defined as external potentials toward the fluid phase. Monte Carlo (MC) molecular simulations are conducted in order to assess the density profiles resulting from the Helmholtz energy functional used in the DFT formalism. Good quantitative agreement between DFT predictions and MC results for Lennard-Jones and ethane nanodroplets is observed, both for density profiles and for contact angles. That comparison suggests, first, that the Helmholtz energy functional proposed in a previous study [Sauer, E.; Gross, J. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 56, 2017, 4119-4135] is suitable for three-phase contact lines and, second, that Lagrange multipliers can be used to constrain the number of molecules, similar to a canonical ensemble. Experiments of sessile droplets on solid surfaces are performed to assess whether a real solid with its microscopic roughness can be described through a simple model potential. Comparison of DFT results to experimental data is done for a Teflon surface because Teflon can be regarded as a substrate exhibiting only attractive interactions of van der Waals type. It is shown that the real solid can be described as a perfectly planar solid with effective solvent-to-solid interactions, defined through a single adjustable parameter for the solid. Subsequent predictions for the contact angle of eight solvents, including polar components such as water, are found in very good agreement to experimental data using simple Berthelot-Lorentz combining rules. For the eight investigated solvents, we find mean absolute deviations of 3.77\textdegree.},

In this work, we develop a DFT with an accurate molecular-based equation of state to calculate thermodynamic properties using fundamental measure theory (FMT), which is a rigorous approach for the treatment of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous hard-sphere fluids. A theoretical framework results with adsorbing molecules treated as hard-sphere chains with square-well attractive interactions. The Mansoori-Carnahan-Starling-Leland and Carnahan-Starling-Boublik equations of state are used for the hard-sphere interactions, and a version of the statistical associating fluid theory for potentials of variable range (SAFT-VR) is used to describe the square-well fluid. First- and second-order perturbative attractive terms are included in the theory. Theoretical predictions are in good agreement with published results for Monte Carlo simulations of the adsorption of chain molecules. In an extension to published studies, the impact of potentials of increasing complexity are compared using square-well and Lennard-Jones wall potentials. For more realistic adsorption of molecules of varying chain length, full slit-shaped pores are modeled using a 10-4 wall potential. The new approach provides accurate predictions of adsorption of chain molecules in model systems. It should be useful for predicting adsorption on flat surfaces and in slit-shaped pores as well as for analyzing experimental data.},

  abstract = {Application of classical density functional theory in cylindrical coordinates requires a fast Hankel transform algorithm of order zero and its inverse, when the involved convolution integrals are solved in Fourier space. Vector-valued fundamental measure theory requires a fast Hankel transform of first order and its inverse. Compared to na\"ive real space convolution, this not only reduces complexity of the required computer code, but also increases computational performance due to the efficiency of the fast Hankel transform. This study proposes a new approach to compute the inverse of the first order fast Hankel transform on equidistant grids as a combination of a modified inverse Abel transform and a fast sine transform. Equidistant grids have a significant advantage over alternative implementations that require logarithmic grid spacing, since most problems, such as pores or droplets, require a certain resolution in the outer region of the radial domain, which in the case of a logarithmic grid necessitates an overly high number of grid points in the inner region of the radial domain. The proposed algorithm for the modified inverse Abel transform is straightforward to implement, while for the fast sine transform off-the-shelf algorithms can be used.},

  abstract = {Classical density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful tool for studying solvation or problems where resolution of interfacial domains or interfacial properties among phases (or thin films) is required. Many interesting problems necessitate multi-dimensional modeling, which calls for robust and efficient algorithmic implementations of the Helmholtz energy functionals. A possible approach for achieving efficient numerical solutions is using the convolution theorem of the Fourier transform. This study is meant to facilitate research and application of DFT methods, by providing a detailed guide on solving DFT problems in multi-dimensional domains. Methods for efficiently solving the convolution integrals in Fourier space are presented for Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates. For cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems, rotational and spherical symmetry is exploited, respectively. To enable easy implementation, our approach is based on fast Fourier, fast Hankel, fast sine and cosine transforms on equidistant grids, all of which can be applied using off-the-shelf algorithms. Subtle details for implementing algorithms in cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems are emphasized. The work covers functionals based on weighted densities exemplarily. Functionals according to fundamental measure theory (FMT) as well as a Helmholtz energy functional based on the perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) equation of state are worked out in detail (and given as Supporting Information).},

  abstract = {Dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) allows the description of microscopic dynamical processes on the molecular scale extending classical DFT to non-equilibrium situations. Since DDFT and DFT use the same Helmholtz energy functionals, both predict the same density profiles in thermodynamic equilibrium. We propose a molecular DDFT model, in this work also referred to as hydrodynamic DFT, for mixtures based on a variational principle that accounts for viscous forces as well as diffusive molecular transport via the generalized Maxwell\textendash Stefan diffusion. Our work identifies a suitable expression for driving forces for molecular diffusion of inhomogeneous systems. These driving forces contain a contribution due to the interfacial tension. The hydrodynamic DFT model simplifies to the isothermal multicomponent Navier\textendash Stokes equation in continuum situations when Helmholtz energies can be used instead of Helmholtz energy functionals, closing the gap between micro- and macroscopic scales. We show that the hydrodynamic DFT model, although not formulated in conservative form, globally satisfies the first and second law of thermodynamics. Shear viscosities and Maxwell\textendash Stefan diffusion coefficients are predicted using an entropy scaling approach. As an example, we apply the hydrodynamic DFT model with a Helmholtz energy density functional based on the perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory equation of state to droplet and bubble coalescence in one dimension and analyze the influence of additional components on coalescence phenomena.},

  abstract = {The calculation of interfacial properties, such as the surface tension, from the density functional theory suffers from the overestimation of the critical temperature of all classical Helmholtz energy functionals. A Helmholtz energy functional is here proposed, where the long-range density fluctuations leading to the universal critical scaling behavior are accounted for using a renormalization group theory. The appeal of the approach is its simple implementation, where the renormalization is treated in a local density approximation (LDA). The model is almost exact at the critical point. Away from the critical point, the model reduces to the perturbed chain statistical associated fluid theory (PC-SAFT) equation of state. The conventional PC-SAFT pure component parameters are supplemented with a single substancespecific renormalization parameter, which is adjusted to reproduce the bulk phase critical temperature. The surface tension is obtained with excellent agreement to experimental data for some non-polar and moderately polar substances (alkanes, ethers, acetates and aromatic substances) up to the critical point. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.
