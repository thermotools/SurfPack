  abstract = {A new association scheme for sPC-SAFT, denoted as 2C, is presented for more-accurate predictions of 1-alcohol/ water phase equilibria than with the 2B or 3B association schemes. This 2C association scheme consists of one bipolar association site and one negative electron donor site and is a combination of the 1A and 2B/3B association schemes. The performance of the 2C scheme is evaluated and compared to the 2B and 3B schemes by modeling the vapor\`Aliquid equilibria and liquid\`Aliquid equilibria of alcohol/water, alcohol/alcohol and alcohol/alkane mixtures. Liquid\`Aliquid equilibria of multicomponent systems are also considered. Compared to sPC-SAFT with the 2B or 3B schemes, sPC-SAFT-2C provides improved phase equilibria predictions for the investigated alcohol/water vapor\`Aliquid systems, as well as for liquid\`Aliquid equilibria of water/alcohol/alkane and water/ alcohol/alcohol ternary systems. However, a slight deterioration in the prediction of binary alcohol/alkane phase equilibria is observed with the 2C scheme, compared to the 2B scheme. Furthermore, related VLE predictions with sPC-SAFT-2C compare well to predictions with the Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) equation of state.},

  abstract = {Aqueous mixtures of (C1\textendash C5) alkanols are found in the petrochemical and biofuel industries, amongst others. Molecular interactions, of which hydrogen bonding (association) and polar effects are large contributors, render these mixtures complex and separation becomes a difficult task. For efficient design of separation processes, mixture phase behaviour needs to be understood, and a suitable equation of state is required to represent this behaviour mathematically. Equations of state with sound theoretical foundations have been developed, amongst others the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT). Two SAFT variants were considered in this investigation: simplified Perturbed-Chain SAFT (sPC-SAFT) and SAFT with Variable Range Mie-potential (SAFT-VR Mie). In these models, association schemes are used to describe the amount and type of association sites on a molecule. To explicitly account for polarity, two polar terms, those of Gross and Vrabec (GV), and Jog and Chapman (JC), were considered in this work. While each polar term has a parameter that describes a molecule's degree of polarity, the polar functional group's location is not specified. It is therefore questioned whether the SAFT framework has the ability to account for structural isomerism, in lieu of a positional specifier. Structural isomers of linear (C1\textendash C5) alkanols provide a suitable homologous series for investigation, and their aqueous mixtures are of interest to this study.},
