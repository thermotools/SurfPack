# cDFT_Thermopack
Classical density functinal theory


# Issues
  * Binary weights and accuracy when not using Fourier weights
  * plot binary results vs. MC

# List of todos (Remove when accomplished)
  * Incorporate Anderson mixing [1]
  * Test the chain term implementation
  * Test with a wall potential
  * Find a smarter way to grid up the domain
  * Implement a scale for grid-size
  * Implement postprocessing routine to extract useful variables
  * The thermopack association term implementation must be revised
  * Implement association into the DFT code [2]
  * Learn "tricks of the trade" from Rolf
  * Implement one-dimensional spherical and cylindrical geometries
  * Extract radial distribution function and compare to simulations
  * Implement a consistent WCA-reference, test for the LJs fluid
