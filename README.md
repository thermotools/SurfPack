# SurfPack 

SurfPack is a library for computation of interfacial properties of fluids, and the properties of fluids at interfaces
and in confined systems. The library includes an interface to Classical Density Functional theory, with implementations
of several SAFT-based functionals. The package is implemented in pure python, building on the
[ThermoPack](https://thermotools.github.io/thermopack/) python interface.

For documentation, installation- and getting started guides, see the [SurfPack homepage](https://thermotools.github.io/SurfPack).
